# Arconai Tv Stream Links

On platforms without a Flash player and doesn't support the stream source type
in the <video> tag in browser, a user gets a blank you're-not-supported screen
when navigating to a stream. However, these platforms have applications like
VLC and mplayer that can stream these streams outside of the browser. This
application opens the stream file as a link which can then be associated with
the video player of the user's choosing.
